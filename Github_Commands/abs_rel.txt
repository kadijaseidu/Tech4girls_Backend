Absolute path is when you are moving from a separate directory to another separate directory. It starts from the root directory and includes all the subdirectories leading to the target directory or file. For example, if you have a file located at “/Tech4girls_Backend/Precious/Movement/Hero” that is a root path because it starts from the root directory which is ‘Tech4girls_Backend ‘ and it includes all the subdirectories leading to the targeted directory.
Relative path is moving from a parent directory to its child directory. It does not start from the root but instead gives the location of the file or directory based on its current position. For instance, if you’re in a directory and you want to access a file in a subdirectory, you will use a relative path that specify the location.
