branching in git allows developers to create separate branches when working on a project. Every developer can make changes
to their own separate branch without affecting the main branch, which enables the main branch to be stable and free 
from bugs as well as conflicts. Different collaborators can work on their own branches and when they are done, they 
can now merge their work to the main branch after the work has been reviewed and approved by the other collaborators.
