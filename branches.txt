The git pull command is used to pull changes from ones remote repository to their local repository. It takes the changes from your remote repository and merge the changes into the current branch.
You would use git pull command when you want to include the latest changes made by your collaborators working on a project. For instance, you’re working on a team and your partner has pushed new commits to the repository you both share, you need to run ‘git pull’ to bring those updates into your local copy, ensuring that both the remote repository and the local repository are both on the same page.
